MeetStatusScreen
================

###About
An application for displaying upcoming meet information at an FRC Competition

It will display information about the competition as well as other helpful information:

* When the next meet is
* How long until the next meet (live countdown!)
* Allies Competing and your Alliance Color
* Opponents Competing and their Alliance Color
* Current Weather

###Use

##### Downloading

To use MeetStatusScreen, either download the release or the current source code. The files in the ```project/``` folder are the only files you should need, and you can put these either in the root or in any subdirectory of your website.

##### Hosting

If you want to host it locally during competition, we use [easyPHP](http://www.easyphp.org/) to host our project to localhost, and use [Ngrok](http://www.ngrok.com/) to access the application and dash remotely.

##### Configuration

To customize MeetStatusScreen for your team's use, you'll need to do the following:

 * change the logo.png file to an image of your team (we suggest a PNG for transparency support)
 * copy ```sample-config.php``` to ```config.php``` and customize it with your team's information

##### Miscellany

Lastly, if you do use this, please let us know at gslrobotics@gmail.com. We'd love to know who's making use of our projects!
